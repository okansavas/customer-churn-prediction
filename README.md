# Customer Churn Prediction with ML

This project uses a Telco customer dataset to build a binary classification model that predicts whether a customer will churn or not.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Model building (Logistic Regression & Decision Tree)
4. Evaluation (Accuracy, ROC AUC, Confusion Matrix)
